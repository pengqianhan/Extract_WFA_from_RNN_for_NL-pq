# Regularization in Extracting WFA from RNNs
Welcome to our repository of *Regularization in Extracting Weighted Finite Automata from Recurrent Neural Networks*!

## Main Contributions
Our main contributions are:
+ An empirical rule to deal with the missing data;
+ A regularization approach to repair the overfitting problem in extracting;
+  A Dropout tactic to supply data and regularize in extracting.


## Quick Start

Run demo_extended.ipynb to show datails for implementation.
